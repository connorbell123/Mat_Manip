# Matmanip
Matmanip is a basic Pascal program that allows you to manipulate matrices. Coming Soon! 

## Coming Features
With Matmanip you can; add, subtract and multiply matrices. You can also transpose and inverse matricies. 
Additional, more advanced features coming soon include the solving systems of linear equations. The application will be able to solve a number of linear equations (a system of linear equations) -- by creating an augmented matrix, transforming it into Row Echelon and then displaying the answer for the desired number of variables.
